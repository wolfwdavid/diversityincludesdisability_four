# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-04)

**Core value:** A visitor can experience DID's mission and services in the mode that works for their body and brain — and switch instantly, with the choice remembered. Accessible mode is first-class, not a fallback.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Deploy Proof

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- One site, two persistent modes (not two sites) — one accessible DOM themed by `data-mode`, single content source; no drift.
- adapter-static + base path for gh-pages — only viable path; real Pages deploy proven in Phase 1.
- Accessible mode ships zero 3D (lazy-load Premium via dynamic `import()`) — the only hard code-split boundary.
- Auto-select Accessible on `prefers-reduced-motion`/`prefers-contrast` — respect OS signals by default.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4] Premium 3D is MEDIUM-confidence per research (Threlte single-canvas/disposal/context-loss + hero scene design). Run `/gsd:research-phase 4` before planning it.
- [Phase 1/2] DID blue/orange contrast token values must be run through a contrast checker and fixed in the token contract early — HIGH recovery cost if deferred.
- Never commit PII/EIN/creds from the private Notion source; this folder sits in a git tree with public remotes.
